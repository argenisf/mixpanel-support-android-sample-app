# mixpanel-support-android-sample-app
Very basic app to illustrate how to implement our Android (Java) SDK in an Android app

The main branch includes the app's functionality without tracking or even Mixpanel's Android SDK. This is a testing ground to start the implementation.

With that said, you can switch to the mixpanel-implemented branch in which all tracking is already set. Just requires updating with your project token in the `MP_PROJECT_TOKEN` variable within the MainActivity class.
